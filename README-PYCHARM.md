## Introduction
 Simply introduce the project that specically built with PyCharm. 
I believe the simplier the Readme file, the easier to read
- You can also keep this private and organize this GitHub as a private libary for yourself.

- PLEASE DO A DEEP REFRESH if the web doesn't look like the home page. Also try to run on diffrent web browsers if anything not right.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- PyCharm Community IDE: Be More Productive: Save time while PyCharm takes care of the routine. Focus on the bigger things and embrace the keyboard-centric approach to get the most of PyCharm's many productivity features. Get Smart Assistance: PyCharm knows everything about your code. Rely on it for intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes, easy project navigation, and much more.
- Please download open the source folder as a project (right click on the folder that contain main, templates, static, and venv and run as open Python Project using PyCharm).
