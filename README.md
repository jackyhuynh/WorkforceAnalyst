# TEMPLATE for PYTHON Developer using PYCHARM

## Introduction

The project presents the common forms of the software life cycle, which are used throughout the
commercial, industrial, institutional, and even governmental communities. We will discuss the
nature of software and software projects, software development models, software process maturity,
project planning, management, and communication. We will study methods for analysis, design,
testing, and implementation of large, complex software systems by focusing AI/Machine learning
applications.

Apply software engineering principles to applications for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) while also exploring topics related to
software engineering and artificial intelligence (AI).

### Introduction to Software Engineering:

#### 1. What is Software Engineering:
- Software help develop country's economies
- Software Engineering is concerned with theories, methods and tools for professional Software Development
- Expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of GNP (Gross National Product) in all developed countries.

#### 2. Software Costs:
- Software costs often dominate computer system costs. The costs of software on a PC are often greater than the hardware cost
- Software costs more to maintain than it does to develop.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- PyCharm Community IDE: Be More Productive: Save time while PyCharm takes care of the routine. Focus on the bigger things and embrace the keyboard-centric approach to get the most of PyCharm's many productivity features. Get Smart Assistance: PyCharm knows everything about your code. Rely on it for intelligent code completion, on-the-fly error checking and quick-fixes, easy project navigation, and much more.
- Please download open the source folder as a project (right click on the folder that contain main, templates, static, and venv and run as open Python Project using PyCharm).
- PLease download all the necessary packages before run the application. If you use PyCharm, it will take care of your missing package or
```
# or u can use
pip install all-missing-package(replace all-missing-package with the package(packages) that you intend to install)
```

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development enviroment running:
* Install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html) Community Edition.
