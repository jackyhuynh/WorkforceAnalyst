# TEMPLATE for JUPITER notebook

## Introduction
 Simply introduce the project that specically built with Jupiter Notebook. 
I believe the simplier the Readme file, the easier to read.
- You can also keep this private and organize this GitHub as a private libary for yourself.

- Machine Learning

## Python for Data Science Tools:
These are packages that are usually used for Data Science:
- [Python 3 Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)
- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html)
- [Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
- [Mathplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/index.html)

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
- Jupyter Notebook: If you want just test the code, simply go to google and search for jupiter notebook or another Python online IDE. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. 
- Anacoda Navigator: Install Anaconda Navigator if you want to develop data-science projects using Python or R. Anaconda Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface included in Anaconda that allows you to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments and channels without the need to use command line commands. 

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development enviroment running
* [Install Anacoda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/#:~:text=Installing%20Navigator%20Navigator%20is%20automatically%20installed%20when%20you,install%20anaconda-navigator.%20To%20start%20Navigator,%20see%20Getting%20Started.) - If you haven't downloaded and installed Anacoda Navigator yet, here's how to get started.
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try) - Click here to go to the online free Jupiter Notebook.

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:
- There is no download IDE need, all you need is download all the src to your machine and run it.
- Using Jupiter Notebook
- Navigate to the file .ipynb
- hit:
```
Ctrl + Enter
```

## Deployment
All the notebook can be used for research and academic basic function for Python. 

## Built With
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/try)
